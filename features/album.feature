Feature: Provide a consistent standard JSON API endpoint

  In order to build interchangeable front ends
  As a JSON API developer
  I need to allow Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality

  Background:
    Given there are Albums with the following details:
      | title                              | track_count | release_date              |
      | some fake album name               | 12          | 2020-01-08T00:00:00+00:00 |
      | another great album                | 9           | 2019-01-07T23:22:21+00:00 |
      | now that's what I call Album vol 2 | 23          | 2018-02-06T11:10:09+00:00 |
