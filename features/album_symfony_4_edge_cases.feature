Feature: Provide insight into how Symfony 4 behaves on the unhappy path

  In order to eliminate bad Album data
  As a JSON API developer
  I need to ensure Album data meets expected criteria

  Background:
    Given there are Albums with the following details:
      | title                              | track_count | release_date              |
      | some fake album name               | 12          | 2020-01-08T00:00:00+00:00 |
      | another great album                | 9           | 2019-01-07T23:22:21+00:00 |
      | now that's what I call Album vol 2 | 23          | 2018-02-06T11:10:09+00:00 |

  @symfony_4_edge_cases
  Scenario: Must have a non-blank title
    Given the request body is:
